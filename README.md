# OneWire Library

## Description

OneWire lets you access 1-wire devices, such as temperature sensors and ibutton secure memory. For temperature sensors, the DallasTemperature library can be used with this library.

## Installation

### First Method

1. In the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries
1. Then the Library Manager will open and you will find a list of libraries that are already installed or ready for installation.
1. Then search for OneWire using the search bar.
1. Click on the text area and then select the zpecific version and install it.

### Second Method

1. Navigate to the Releases page.
1. Download the latest release.
1. Extract the zip file
1. In the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library

## Requirements

OneWire requires a single 4.7K pullup resistor, connected between the pin and +5 volts. Then just connect each 1-wire device to the pin and ground. Some 1-wire devices can also connect to power, or get their power from the signal wire. Please refer to the specifications for the 1-wire devices you are using.

## Features

- ### Inexpensive

     The 1-wire temperature sensors have become particularly popular, because they're inexpensive and easy to use, providing calibrated digital temperature readings directly.

- ### More tolerant

    1-wire is more tolerant of long wires between sensor and Arduino

- ### Modes

    Many 1-Wire chips can operate in both parasitic and normal power modes

- ### Accession

    MicroLans can be accessed directly by an Arduino, using the mature Arduino OneWire library.

- ### Give back

    OneWire is free for everyone. The licensed document can be copied, redistributed and used in the projects, assignments or anywhere.

## Example

There are many examples implemented where this library is used. You can find other examples from [Github-OneWire](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire/tree/master/examples) and [Arduino-Reference](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html)

- ### DS2408_Switch

  Unlike the most input/output ports, the DS2408 doesn't have mode bits to set whether the pins are input or output.  If you issue a read command, they're inputs.  If you write to them, they're outputs.

  - For reading from a switch, you should use 10K pull-up resisters.

``` Cpp

#include <OneWire.h>
OneWire net(10);

void PrintBytes(const uint8_t* addr, uint8_t count, bool newline=false) {
  for (uint8_t i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    Serial.print(addr[i]>>4, HEX);
    Serial.print(addr[i]&0x0f, HEX);
  }
  if (newline)
    Serial.println();
}

void setup(void) {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop(void) {
  byte addr[8];

  if (!net.search(addr)) {
    Serial.print("No more addresses.\n");
    net.reset_search();
    delay(1000);
    return;
  }

  if (OneWire::crc8(addr, 7) != addr[7]) {
    Serial.print("CRC is not valid!\n");
    return;
  }

  if (addr[0] != 0x29) {
    PrintBytes(addr, 8);
    Serial.print(" is not a DS2408.\n");
    return;
  }

  Serial.print("  Reading DS2408 ");
  PrintBytes(addr, 8);
  Serial.println();

  uint8_t buf[13];
  buf[0] = 0xF0;
  buf[1] = 0x88;
  buf[2] = 0x00;
  net.write_bytes(buf, 3);
  net.read_bytes(buf+3, 10);
  net.reset();

  if (!OneWire::check_crc16(buf, 11, &buf[11])) {
    Serial.print("CRC failure in DS2408 at ");
    PrintBytes(addr, 8, true);
    return;
  }
  Serial.print("  DS2408 data = ");
  Serial.println(buf[3], BIN);
}
```
